## Bongoat Additions
This mod is distributed with an [MIT liscense](https://opensource.org/license/mit/). 

This is the sourcecode for the Bongoat Additions mod.
There isn't a lot to go over.

The mod adds 2 items:
- Bongoat
- Smiling Bongoat

and one block:
- Bongoat Block


The Bongoat item can be made by smelting a diamond. From there, you can likely figure out the other recipes with the Minecraft recipe book or JEI.

The block and items have special sound properties. The items say different lines for certain users, but otherwise they're fairly standard.
In the future I might add multiple possible sounds/dialogue lines for different interactions, or even add new interactions.

You can contact me by leaving comments here or on the CurseForge page.
